# cicdInteg
# The "cicdInteg" project is a Cypress testing initiative designed to evaluate the integration of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. 
# This project has been specifically created to test the seamless integration of various components within the CI/CD pipeline. By employing Cypress, a testing framework, 
# "cicdInteg" aims to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the CI/CD processes. The testing scenarios within the project are crafted to validate the functionality and cohesion of the pipeline, ensuring that each stage of the CI/CD process operates as intended. Through systematic testing, "cicdInteg" contributes to the robustness and efficiency of the overall development and deployment workflow.
